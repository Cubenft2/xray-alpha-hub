# Claude Quality Check Integration

## Overview

Claude (Anthropic) has been integrated as a final quality review layer in the daily market brief generation pipeline. This adds a professional-grade review step that catches errors, improves formatting, and verifies accuracy before briefs are published.

## How It Works

### Pipeline Flow

```
1. OpenAI GPT-4o generates initial brief
2. Editorial review & deduplication
3. Structure validation & repair
4. Placeholder substitution
5. Numeric validation & auto-correction
6. 🤖 CLAUDE QUALITY CHECK (NEW!)
7. Final validation
8. Save to database
```

### What Claude Reviews

#### 1. **Factual Errors**
- Verifies prices match provided data
- Removes contradictory statements
- Checks percentage changes are logical

#### 2. **Hallucinations**
- Removes phantom/invalid tickers
- Deletes made-up statistics
- Removes "Market Indicator" placeholder spam

#### 3. **Formatting Issues**
- Fixes broken section headers
- Cleans garbled text: `P (500):` → `SPDR S&P 500 ETF (SPY):`
- Ensures proper ticker format: `CompanyName (TICKER):` not `(TICKER):`
- Fixes currency format: `Currency (EUR/USD):` not `Currency (EUR): /USD)`

#### 4. **Repetition**
- Removes duplicate sentences
- Eliminates redundant information
- Consolidates repeated facts

#### 5. **Clarity**
- Fixes unclear sentences
- Improves readability
- Ensures logical flow

## Error Handling

Claude quality check is **graceful and failsafe**:

```typescript
// If ANTHROPIC_API_KEY is not set
⚠️ ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set, skipping Claude quality check
// Returns original content, continues normally

// If Claude API returns error
❌ Claude API error: 429 Rate limit exceeded
// Returns original content, continues normally

// If Claude request fails
❌ Claude quality check failed: [error details]
// Returns original content, continues normally
```

## Comparison: OpenAI vs Claude

### OpenAI GPT-4o (Creative Generation)
- **Strengths:** Creative, conversational, context-aware
- **Weaknesses:** Can hallucinate, inconsistent formatting, repetitive

### Claude Sonnet 4 (Quality Review)
- **Strengths:** Factual accuracy, instruction-following, error detection
- **Weaknesses:** More expensive, slower for generation

### The Combo = Best Results
**OpenAI generates creative content → Claude reviews for accuracy**

This two-step approach combines the strengths of both:
- OpenAI's creativity and market insight
- Claude's precision and quality control

## Alternatives to Claude

If you don't want to use Claude, you can:

1. **Skip review entirely** - Just use OpenAI output
2. **Use GPT-4o for review** - More expensive, less accurate at catching errors
3. **Manual review** - Time-consuming but free
4. **Rule-based validation** - Already implemented (numeric validation, structure repair)

**Recommendation:** Claude review is worth the $5-10/month for serious applications.

## Future Enhancements

### Potential Improvements

1. **Selective review** - Only review sections with high error rates
2. **Caching** - Cache Claude reviews for similar content
3. **Progressive enhancement** - Start without Claude, enable after reaching users
4. **A/B testing** - Compare briefs with/without Claude to measure impact
5. **Custom prompts** - Fine-tune review instructions per brief type
6. **Quality scoring** - Track improvement metrics over time
